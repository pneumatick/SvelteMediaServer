# SvelteMediaServer

This is an attempt at making a home media server that I would actually want to use in my daily life. Once it's half-way decent I'll add a license so that anyone can do what they want with it.

# Installing dependencies

The required dependencies can be installed with

```npm install```

# Starting the server

The server can be started with

```npm start```

# Videos
To add videos to the server, simply add them into the 'videos' directory. Use the list on the right to select the video you would like to play.
